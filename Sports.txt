I know nothing about sports but hey today is the begining of the 'Don't know sports competition' whith the two teams: Bears and Bears.jr. Scoring is tied 3-3. The next game occures tomorrow, where the tie can either break or continue!
A very generic game and the tie remains. Who knows when it will break, it's what's expected when the Bears and Bears.jr play.
A vewry suprising turn of events! The Bears won their first tie breaker. It's now 8-7. I wonder if they can keep it up or if the game will end in a tie like all years past!
AND THEY'VE DONE IT! The Bears have won! What a turn of events! A break of 13-10! That's for the history books!
